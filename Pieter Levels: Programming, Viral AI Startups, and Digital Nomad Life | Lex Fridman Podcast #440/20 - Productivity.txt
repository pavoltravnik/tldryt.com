TLDR Summary:

Pieter Levels describes his ideal productive day, which typically starts around 10-11 AM after going to sleep at 2 AM. He begins with coffee, shower, and coding. He's adapted to work in shorter bursts due to life's interruptions. On extremely productive days without distractions, he might wake up later (1-2 PM) after coding late into the night. He often works alongside friends in a quiet, focused environment.

For maximum productivity, Levels listens to techno music or industrial sounds, finding jazz too distracting. He consumes up to four strong cups of coffee daily during intense work sessions. He doesn't take naps but sleeps well at night.

Levels emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own body and work habits, rather than blindly following general advice. He discusses his products, including RemoteOK, a job board for remote work that became highly profitable during the pandemic.
