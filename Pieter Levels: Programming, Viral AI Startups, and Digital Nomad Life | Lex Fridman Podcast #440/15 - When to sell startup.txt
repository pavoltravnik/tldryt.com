TLDR Summary:

The speaker, who has never sold his companies, discusses the challenges and considerations of exiting a startup:

1. Acquisition deals often involve manipulation and due diligence processes that can take 6-12 months.
2. Buyers may lower the valuation after seeing everything, using it as a negotiation tactic.
3. Companies are typically sold at multiples of 3-5 times revenue or profit.
4. For highly profitable, automated businesses, it may make more financial sense to wait and continue operating rather than selling.
5. Selling becomes attractive when multiples reach 6-8 times revenue/profit.
6. The value of some companies lies not just in their interface or content, but in their user base and community.
7. Emotional attachment to a company can make selling difficult, especially if the company has a meaningful mission.
8. Selling a company can lead to post-exit depression and a loss of identity for founders.
9. The speaker believes it's better to keep working on meaningful projects rather than retiring.

Noteworthy Quotes:

"Financially, it doesn't really make sense to sell. Unless the price high enough. If the price gets to six or seven or eight, I don't wanna wait six years for the money. But if you give me three, like three years is nothing. I can wait."

"I think it's good to keep working until you die. Just keep working on cool stuff and you shouldn't retire. I think retirement's bad probably."

"There's a very famous depression after start finding a solar company. They're like, this was me. Like who am I? And they immediately start building another one."
