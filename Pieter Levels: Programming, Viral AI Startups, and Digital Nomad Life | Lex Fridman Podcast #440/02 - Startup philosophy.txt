Notable Quotes:

"I think creative expression is like a meaningful work that's so important. It's so fun. It's so fun to have like a daily challenge where you try figure stuff out."

"I have a lot of founder friends and they tell me secretly. With hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and stuff, they tell me, 'Next time, if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it like you because it's more fun, it's more indie, it's more chill, it's more creative.'"
